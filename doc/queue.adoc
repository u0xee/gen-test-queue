= Queue: A First-In-First-out (FIFO) data structure

A queue is a First-In First-Out (FIFO) data structure, commonly used in
situations where you want to process items in the order they are created
or queued. One common model of usage for a queue is to have one thread
adding work to the queue, and another processing work from the queue.
The following image shows a conceptual image of a queue. The front of
the queue is where items are removed, and the rear of the queue is where
items are added.
